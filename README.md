# PP-Flickr Corpus

Sebastien Delecraz, Alexis Nasr, Frederic Bechet, Benoit Favre

This corpus is an extension of the [Flickr30k Entities](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~bplumme2/Flickr30kEntities/) corpus created by adding some syntactic annotations in order to study the joint processing of image and language features for the Preposition-Phrase attachment disambiguation task. The annotation has been performed on the English version of the captions and automatically projected on their French and German translations.
